<h2>Politics: Green Socialist Ferrat Party announce their new manifesto</h2>
<p>The newly formed Green Socialist Ferrat Party, formed from the merger of the Ferret, Green
    Anarchist Rat and Separatist Socialist Union Parties,
    announced its first official manifesto yesterday. The
    manifesto includes numerous major policies, such as
    pursuing media regulation, standardised polygon
    naming, establishing a state-owned school, and
    sorting out the Discord server and administrative
    divisions. This article aims to explain their manifesto
    to help you make up your mind on who you will vote
    for in the presidential election tomorrow, and which
    party you should be in.</p>

<h3>Media Regulation</h3>
<p>The party will establish a new ministry, the Ministry
    for the Regulation of Media Outlets (MoRMO), which
    will run a system of media licenses. An outlet must
    possess such such a license in order to legally
    operate.</p>
<h3>Educational Reform</h3>
<p>A 'Cheeselandic National School' will be established. This will be responsible for
    providing a high-quality education on Cheeselandic history and politics to all
    citizens, and will be funded and owned by the government through taxes.</p>

<h3>Discord Server</h3>
<p>The party aims to clean up the New New Cheeseland Discord server by restoring
    the original channel categories, reinstating key channels from the 'deleted archived
    channels' category. This is a policy that is a the heart of Alan, the party leader, 's
    presidential campaign.</p>
<h3>Administrative Divisions</h3>
<p>The party will 'sort out the country's administrative divisions', which will likely
    include rectifing the constitutional loophole created by the migration of the nation's
    population from the pond to the flagstones outside the Walker Building in some
    way. Alan, who initially proposed the policy, has stated "This will not be done
    through a constitutional amendment, so it is constitutional".</p>
<h3>Other Policies</h3>
<p>The party also aims to ban the following actions:
    <ul>
        <li>Pushing into a queue.</li>
        <li>Harming or killing a ferret (or ferrat).</li>
    </ul>

<h3>The Chaos Party's Policies</h3>
<p>The Chaos Party has not announced an
    official manifesto, so Short Story Long is
    assuming that they will continue to use their
    old manifesto, which includes the following
    policies:
    <ul>
        <li>Establish a Ministry of Health to provide
            plasters to those citizens who need them.</li>
        <li>Create dedicated channels for gaming discussion and debates.</li>
    </ul>

<h2>Business: Louis launches 'Cheese Publishing' to
    replace Wekkly Chese</h2>
<p>Louis, creator of the epic website <a href="http://cheese.animateshadows.org">cheese.animateshadows.org</a>, has launched
    'Cheese Publishing', which will publish the Wekkly Chese, now written by Alan, as
    well as a Weekly summary of the week's Geography lessons and homework co-
    written by James and Louis.
    Short Story Long is also planning on entering into a contract with Cheese
    Publishing to have the newspaper hosted on the site, but will still continue to post in
    #short-story-long, and will remain not-for-profit and independent.
    The new website is 'minimal' according to its creator, but still possesses a 'light' and
    'dark' theme, with a third theme, 'twilight' also planned.</p>

<h2>Politics: New New Cheeseland remains silence on
    death of Queen</h2>
<p>The New New Cheeseland government has yet to make any comment on the death
    of notable world leader Elizabeth II. Alan has theorised that this is due to New New
    Cheeseland having declared independence from Britain in the recent past, and as
    such not wanting to make a potentially controversial statement on the passing.
    Other theories include an anti-monarchist stance created by the revolution against
    the authoritarian rule of the King of Honse, or the fact New New Cheeseland has
    yet to recognise the existence of any other world leader, and would largely have
    little to say about the Queen.</p>
